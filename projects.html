                Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful 
                tool in education, with Large Language Models (LLMs) offering 
                significant opportunities to support student learning and educator 
                instruction. This study investigates the comparative performance of 
                four LLMs in solving math problems across three key domains: 
                Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics. A data set of 30 questions, 
                ranging in complexity and domain, was used to evaluate the accuracy, 
                clarity, and valuability of each model's responses. Evaluations were 
                conducted by a human evaluators familiar with the subjects.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                Results revealed that while all models performed similarly in terms 
                of accuracy, the other two categories highlighted performance gaps. 
                Meta AI emerged as the top performer, excelling in clarity and value, 
                particularly in Calculus and Statistics. Julius AI demonstrated 
                strength in solving complex word problems, whereas Gemini excelled at 
                simpler problems. ChatGPT, however, consistently underperformed in all 
                metrics, making it less reliable as a math resource. These findings offer 
                insights into the capabilities of AI tools for math education, equipping 
                educators and students with guidance on model selection based on the type 
                and domain of the problem.

                Abstract: Areas with high levels of agriculture can lead to fertilizer runoff in the surrounding rivers, which
                can cause high levels of phosphorus, a major component of fertilizer, in the water. In this study, the
                concentrations of phosphorus in rivers were measured in various locations throughout the regions of Great
                Falls and Missoula in Montana. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI, was used to measure
                photosynthetic productivity of the vegetation along the riverbanks at each location where samples were
                taken using an UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). The aim of this study was to determine whether or not
                phosphorus concentrations in rivers have an effect on the NDVI values, which indicates plant health, on
                the surrounding land vegetation. The data collected suggest phosphorus concentration in water had a weak
                positive correlation with the NDVI values of the land vegetation within 5 m of the edge of the river,
                although further research would have to take place in order to better investigate this finding as this study
                only included a small sample size.

                Abstract: Handwriting recognition is an essential application of 
                machine learning that enables the conversion of handwritten text 
                into digital formats. This technology has significant implications 
                for accessibility, education, historical document preservation, and 
                digital data security. However, recognizing handwritten text presents 
                challenges due to the high variability in handwriting styles, 
                character spacing, and distortions. In this study, we implemented a 
                Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten names 
                from images. We utilized a dataset of over 400,000 images from 
                Kaggle, which was preprocessed and reduced due to computational 
                constraints. Despite extensive training over 50 epochs, our model 
                achieved a low Character Accuracy Rate (CAR) of 6.77% and a high 
                Character Error Rate (CER) of 10.063, highlighting significant 
                challenges in effective model training and loss function 
                optimization. The study identifies key limitations, 
                including resource constraints, hyperparameter selection, and loss 
                function inefficiencies, suggesting that improvements in 
                computational resources and alternative loss functions may enhance 
                performance. While our model did not perform as intended, this 
                research provided valuable insights into the complexities of 
                handwriting recognition and the practical difficulties of training 
                deep learning models with limited resources.
